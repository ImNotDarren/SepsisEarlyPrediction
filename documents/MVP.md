## Data analysis
I concatenated each individual patient readings into one dataset, and cleaned
the data by adding a patient id column, removing columns with too many missing
values and so on. The files for data analysis are [here](../data_processing).

## Baseline model
The baseline model I built using decision tree and bagging aggregation is shown
[here](../models/baseline_model.ipynb).
